# Sentiment Analysis

In this project work we have used the twitter dataset to develop an experimental approach to analyze the reactions of people on Twitter considering the popular words either directly or indirectly based on this pandemic. Using the data various models like Na√Øve Bayes, Logistic Regression, LSTM and attention models were generated. All these models were validated with set of training data. The Logistic Regression model predicts the output with the highest accuracy of 0.83 among other models.
